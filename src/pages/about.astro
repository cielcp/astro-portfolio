                <h1>Hello</h1>
                <p> I’m Ciel, a 2024 graduate from the University of Virginia, where I studied a blend of computer science, psychology, and design.</p>
                <p> Previously I’ve worked for a nonprofit, a startup, and an agency, where I worked on feature launches, experimented with animation, and learned professional web development.</p>
                <p> Apart from UX/UI, I love fashion, journaling, cozy games, ramen noodles, playing tennis, and books — currently (May 2025), I'm reading The Creative Act by Rick Rubin.</p>
                <p> Thanks for reading, and for visiting my page :) If you have any feedback, questions, or ideas for collaboration, I’d love to hear from you!</p>
